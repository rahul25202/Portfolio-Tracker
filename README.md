## Assumptions and Limitations
- The application relies on real-time stock data fetched from Yahoo Finance.
- Stock data updates every minute.
- The application assumes valid stock ticker symbols for search functionality.
- Render often "spin down" your application when it's inactive for a certain period.
When a new request comes in, the service needs to "spin up" the application again, 
leading to cold start delays, which can significantly increase response times for the first request.
